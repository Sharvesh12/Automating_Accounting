# Automating_Accounting
Abc company offers Factoring to SMEs “at the push of a button”, financing thousands of invoices each month. We need to reflect each of these receivables in our accounting books. Doing this manually would be a daunting (and mind-numbing) task. Instead of hiring an army of accountants, we want to automate this process as much as possible.
# Challenge
You have been asked to build a “proof of concept” for this process. Using the dummy data
extract provided, your task is to create the relevant journal entries that we will need to upload
into our accounting system (in the journal entry import format provided).

Create all relevant bookings for one month of factoring transactions (October 2019)
on Abc’s factoring platform. Feel free to make simplifying assumptions where
necessary. We care about how you structure your workings as much as the
correctness of your solution.
