# Automating_Accounting
Abc company offers Factoring to SMEs “at the push of a button”, financing thousands of invoices each month. We need to reflect each of these receivables in our accounting books. Doing this manually would be a daunting (and mind-numbing) task. Instead of hiring an army of accountants, we want to automate this process as much as possible.
